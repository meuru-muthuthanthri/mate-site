You will need to create or source the following client images:

1. client-1.jpg - Saman Perera (CEO, Lanka Retail Solutions)
   - Professional headshot of a male business person
   - Size: 200x200px (will be displayed as a circle)

2. client-2.jpg - Priyanka Fernando (CTO, Ceylon Finance)
   - Professional headshot of a female business person
   - Size: 200x200px (will be displayed as a circle)

3. client-3.jpg - Rohan De Silva (Marketing Director, Sri Travel)
   - Professional headshot of a male business person
   - Size: 200x200px (will be displayed as a circle)

For each image:
- Use high-quality, professional headshots
- Ensure images are properly licensed for commercial use
- Crop images to be square (they will be displayed as circles)
- Use consistent lighting and style across all testimonial images
- Ideally, use images of actual clients with their permission

You can source images from:
- Photos of your actual clients (with their permission)
- Professional stock photo websites
- If using fictional testimonials for demonstration purposes, clearly indicate this in your documentation
